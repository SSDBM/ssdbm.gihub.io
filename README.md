# SSDBM Website

This repository contains the web files and images for the [SSDBM web site](http://www.ssdbm.org), which provides pointers to the annual conference sites for the Scientific and Statistical Database Management Conference.

## For conference organizers

Conference organizers for SSDBM conferences often register their own web domain, but they are also welcome to use a subdomain under http://ssdbm.org to distribute conference materials.  They are also welcome to create a repository under the [GitHub SSDBM organization](https://github.com/SSDBM) to hold and manage annual conference materials in a GitHub repository.  Finally, as new conferences are announced, they can be added to the conference index via a pull request against this main website repository.   If pull requests aren't you're thing, or you want a repository for an annual conference created, just contact K Wu (KWu at lbl.gov).  This site now uses [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages/) for most recent conferences.  Feel free to email.
