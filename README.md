# SSDBM Website

This repository contains the web files and images for the [SSDBM web site](http://www.ssdbm.org), which provides pointers to the annual conference sites for the Scientific and Statistical Database Management Conference.

## For conference organizers

Conference organizers for SSDBM conferences often register their own web domain, but they are also welcome to use a subdomain under http://ssdbm.org to distribute conference materials.  They are also welcome to create a repository under the GitHub SSDBM organization to hold and manage annual conference materials.  Finally, as new conferences are announced, they can be added to the conference web site by proposing a pull request against this main website repository.   If pull requests aren't you're thing, or you want a repository for an annual conference created, just contact Matt Jones (jones at nceas.ucsb.edu). Although sites have not yet used GutHub Pages for annual conference sites, that may make sense for future conferences.
